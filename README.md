# Deployment Process

### Netlify Sign up process & connect Netlify to Github project

1. At the beginning of the Netlify sign-up process, there is an option to connect with a Github account or with Gmail. In my case, I used Gmail to sign up for my Netlify account.

2. Then, to deploy a Github project to Netlify, you can do it by connecting your Netlify account with your Github account.

### Auto Deployment on Github with Netlify

1. After that, you will choose 'add new site' and select 'import an existing project'.

2. After that, you select the account and repository you want to deploy. You will also choose the site name at this step.

2. And then, you will configure DNS by entering the Netlify hostname into the name servers at your domain provider. Then you will wait for the entered DNS to be verified.
